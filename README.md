# Stardew-Quiz
Stardew Quiz is a passion project developed by me, together with Boulean Daniel using Unity as a game engine and C# as a programing language. It's a trivia game based on the popular video game Stardew Valley, meant to test the player's knowledge on different aspects of Stardew Valley's gameplay and mechanics.
